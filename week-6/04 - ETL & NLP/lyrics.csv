You Will Never Work In Television Again,chelechepe,['The Smile'],6DaKU06d03UDpVjPZhF19X,databcn072022,"You Will Never Work in Television Again Lyrics[Verse 1]
Fear not my love, he's a fat fucking mist
Young bones spat out, girls slitting their wrists
Curtain calling for the kiss, from the nursery rhyme
Behind some rocks, underneath some bridge
Some gangster troll promising the moon

[Refrain]
Yeah right
Sleep tight
All night
[Verse 2]
Some kid, in golden chains, two slippery ropes
A lonely stitch, left to be unpicked, including my left foot
Let the lights down low, bunga bunga or
You'll never work in television again

[Refrain]
Yeah right

[Bridge]
He chews 'em up, he spits 'em out
It's whatshisname, the gеnie man
Mechanical, mechanical
All thosе beautiful young hopes and dreams
Devoured by those evil eyes and those piggy limbs
You sad fuck, you throw small change
Take your dirty hands off my love

Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you

[Verse 1]
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh
[Chorus]
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
Answer the phone
""Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?""
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

Ooh, top five top five top five top five I mean no doubt
True, repo make sure we took your house we need the couch
Too late, where you been at? Where you at? We need the fence
Mayne, so much that kid snuck from the bathroom off the fence
Mayne, we bump your shit like when I'm high and when the rent
Ain’t, several, figures, where your friends?
Say wassup to the option and all these adoptions
And the Phil was the healer and Robert the doctor
We felt the bruises and knives
And the location implode
Got a little faith in me still
Ayy, yeah, yeah
Hang with the makers, don't fault
Just hang with the makers
Be who you are
Right? TUT
[Verse 2: TUT]
Nigga, bigger and better than all of y'all, anyone
I'll tell him to his face like
Shit, riding round with the bass like
20 inch rims with them center plates absolutely
Sick of the lies, shucking and jiving
More conniving, I'm riding in my G-30 fizz-ive
Rolling up weed in my G-30 fizz-ive
Made a lot of green in my G-30 fizz-ive (yeurn)
Back and bossed up
I just touched down, I Randy Moss’d 'em
I be taking the payment, stacking the savings
Can't blow all your cheddar my dog, you do better
Running through the city sitting pretty like hair on hoes
I'm here, I'm home, I'm high off life
I'm high off sprite, mixed with a little hi-tech
We got twenty bags, we got dime sacks
Never play myself short now it's off to the airport
Another classic got niggas waiting to export
More spiritual than lyrical
But still I need my residual, absolutely
Never find it even with credit cards
I hold my nuts, and when I hit that wall I run through it
'Til my niggas hit that mall and run through it
This is more than music, nigga I swear that
[Pre-Hook:  TUT & Isaiash Rashad]
I'ma get a Roley and a house just like Uncle Willy
Big ass house in the woods
Kick my shitty ass bucket to the curb when I start rollin' 'round in a Bentley
Got a ride in a big ass ride
Might pull up on my old hoes just so I can stunt on the bitches
Stunt on them broke ass hoes
Cause we just went and did a lot of shit, just so we could say that we did it

[Hook: TUT]
Ayy, I got the bounce to make you feel like
Yeah, nappy 'fro got the hoes like
Yeah, Shell Toes on my toes like
Big homie on the phone like
""Fuck up them niggas man just be true to yourself
That's what you made for
That's what you prayed for
Nigga everybody gotta hustle for somthin'
Work for the come-up
Influence the culture""
Like I'm a leader

[Bridge: TUT]
This the shit that we used to talk about in my G-30 fizz-ive
Had about an ounce and a digi-scale in the rizzide
TUT be off the easy fo-sheezy
Moving on up like George and Weezie
[Verse 3: TUT]
Y'all so sleep nigga wake up
Young ass nigga about to fuck the game up
So impressed, I'm so invested
Shit ain't been the same since, the mom on Fresh Prince
It's funny how we switched the game up
Took niggas to church like a church bus
Fuck the bullshit this is real rap
Preacher's Son a year old and it still slap
I might, pull up on a rapper tell 'em get on this shit
Boy you a mess, make it look so easy do you see the finesse? Building your job
Searching for your surface out of vacant facade
My God, we thank God we living it up
When the world got you down, I'll be building you up
Ain't shit to it it's just music
Don't let fear of failure scare you

[Interlude: TUT & Friend]
Ahhhh King TUT my nigga, what's going on?
What's going on man, how you doing?
Hey I see you and Isaiah Rashad holding it down in these streets man, putting on for Chattanooga the city
Yeah man, I appreciate it man
Oh yeah man, lemme' ask you a question. You think you can sell a nigga 20 sack man?
Nah man I can't do that man I don't even sell weed
Hey man you can't sell a 20 sack man?
Man if I could I would, bruh I promise
Aight well, can I at least pray for you, lemme get your hands

Yeah
Now, everybody tellin' me a lie
Lordy, give me somethin' for my soul
See, I don't wanna think of suicide
So please don't take the lockey off my door
See, I been tired of fuckin' all these girls
And I've been tired of spendin' all my dough
And if I give my story to the world
I wonder if they'd book me for a show
See you can't handle pressure on your own
So why you carry boulder by yourself?
The story’s storyteller tell it wrong
And glorify the horror and the wealth
My mama call me, tell me, ""Comey home""
And I just need some guidance in my steps
I know I'm not the only one alone
I know I'm not the only one that felt

Yeah
Now, I'm prayin' that I make it twenty-five
Baby call a doctor for my health
And ""no"" is kinda hard to say to drugs
'Cause I been havin' problems with myself
And I been askin' questions, where the love?
And they don't give me answers, just a check
And they don't know my issues as a child
'Cause I was busy cuttin' on myself
And hangin' from the playground wasn't wrong
Until you got a ropey on your neck
And I been losin' more than just my mind
Gatherin' what's left of self-respect
And Daddy, why you call me while you drunk?
And why you never love me when I need it?
And I don't wanna be like you no more
And I been tryna cope, I'm gettin' weeded

Oh, I think I'm falling
Heavenly Father, why are you so far away?

Yeah, look, ayy
I smoke too much: the problems of a twenty-somethin'
I drink too often, there's liquor pourin' from the faucet
You would assume from followin' the tunes (Yeah)
That I'm doomed to die young, addicted to dry plum
These bitches ain't shit, and pussy is my greatest vice
I love smokin' weed, I hate advice
I know some niggas that talk good, the wise men
From a long line of bitch-made and brides-men (Ooh, ooh)
You never had nuttin' but fuckin' dreams
You just caught up in the hype, the fashion and so it seems
The limelight, I know that I rhyme tight
No need for your two cents and burnin' your blueprints
These people think I really give a fuck about the shit they give a fuck about
Just need a moment of silence, just close your fuckin' mouth
Infatuated with violence, gun in my fuckin' mouth
So you don't know that I'm serious, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?

Like, you got punchlines for days
So generic your flow, you too cold, you aged

Let's stare at the stars
Past curfew
Lets watch the seeds grow into trees
And then blossom into flowers
Take time to smell the roses
Freeze the moment, poses
Sometimes it's better when you peel back time layer by layer
Take every moment
And savour the flavour
Of the past, the present and the days that will last forever

You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park, but meantime
South of the river, you stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie, double-four time
You feel alright when you hear the music ring

[Verse 2]
Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the Jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town
[Verse 3]
Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

[Verse 4]
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the Honky Tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing
Yeah

[Verse 5]
And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole

And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last, just as the time bell rings
""Goodnight, now it's time to go home""
Then he makes it fast with one more thing

We are the Sultans of Swing""

I don't think I'll ever, no, Lord
See the sun from here

[Chorus]
And oh, as I fade away
They'll all look at me and say
And they'll say
""Hey, look at him
I'll never live that way""
And that's okay
They're just afraid to change
[Verse 2]
And when you feel your life ain't worth living
You've got to stand up, and take a look around you
Then you look up, way to the sky-y-y, yeah
And when your deepest thoughts are broken
Keep on dreamin', boy
'Cause when you stop dreamin', it's time to die, yeah

[Verse 3]
And as we all play parts of tomorrow, Lord knows
Some ways, we'll work, yeah
And other ways, we'll play
But I know we can't all stay here forever
So, I wanna write my words on the face of today
And then, they'll paint it

And oh, as I fade away
They'll all look at me and say

Там, за турникетом ждали холода
В поисках, в поисках

Вылетел в окно
Улетел-улетел
В самый в свой нескучный рай
И случайно выронил главную деталь
Я случайно потерял саму тебя
Как-нибудь наизусть
Перескажем каждому
Как мы не сдавались отпускать весну
В сотый раз заново
С привкусом горечи
Что осталось нам
Это просто отпустить

Просто отпустить
Просто отпустить
Давай

Доктор мне прописал
Не смотреть в твои глаза
Знаешь получалось только не сейчас
Отвернись-отвернись
Не смотри пожалуйста
Я же не из стали
Вдруг ещё сломаюсь

Давай не будем разрезать

I am sitting in the morning
At the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter
For the man to pour the coffee

And he fills it only halfway
And before I even argue
He is looking out the window
At somebody coming in
""It is always nice to see you""
Says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in
She is shaking her umbrella

And I look the other way
As they are kissing their hellos
And I'm pretending not to see them
And Instead I pour the milk

Oh no, it is always nice to see you
It is always nice to see you
It is always nice to see you
It is always nice to see you

It is al-al-always nice
Al-al-always nice
It is always nice to see you

F*ck Up Some Commas,Hassan,['Future'],6DaKU06d03UDpVjPZhF19X,databcn072022,"Wrong LyricsInstrumental: F*ck Up Some Commas by Future

[Hook] x2
Fuck up with me?
Then you must not have heard
Put me in dirt?
Then I’ll fuck up the Earth
Do what I do when I fuck up a verse
But I’ll do it you when I fuck up the world
That’s how I react
Hence why I feel like I need this track
Won’t even take too long
All you gotta do is do me wrong
[First Verse]
I’m feeling so offbeat
Every step expecting to drop
Knees down to the floor
And the ground couldn’t stop these thoughts
If I fell face flat/ can’t fail/ hate that
I’m back up on my feet that’s not me
Run back to my comfort zone but I refuse to quit
‘Cause I’m cool with this
Take all my flaws/ make music with
I don’t know how these standard emcees
Are reaching a point where they’re setting these standards
Oh well/ hands off their coattails
Eyes on your prize/ don’t gloat when your foes fail
‘Cause it’s not about them
It’s all about you
Don’t jump all smug at the front
And emerge as a prick
Keep going/ ignore what they say
Then do it like Jay and just fuck up the world like…

[Hook] x2
Fuck up with me?
Then you must not have heard
Put me in dirt?

But I’ll do it you when I fuck up the world
That’s how I react
Hence why I feel like I need this track
Won’t even take too long
All you gotta do is do me wrong
[Second Verse]
Feel like I’m overly critical
Show it through poems and flow like I’m lyrical
Fact is I map this anger out to a banger
And attack anyone who’s coming my way
Like I’m doing right now
Everything I write down
Know it’s so typical
Stone cold cynical
Hope so miniscule
Feel so lost but I feel so invincible
Feel I can do it my way
Thinking every minute
“KD, why wait?”
Know I’ve got a talent but I’m still unsure
But that’s life in a cold world
Just love yours; I tell myself
But still fail to accept any help
I feel like I’m doing it wrong
The newer the song
The better I feel
But never reveal
How I feel when I see they’re all moving along

[Hook]
Fuck up with me?
Then you must not have heard
Put me in dirt?
Then I’ll fuck up the Earth
Do what I do when I fuck up a verse
But I’ll do it you when I fuck up the world
That’s how I react
Hence why I feel like I need this track
Won’t even take too long
All you gotta do is do me wrong
[Third Verse]
Fuck this
Frustrated, everything is too much
And I erupt in a rage/ can’t function
Doused in a ‘bout of confusion and numbness
Why do I care what the fuck you want?
I’m doing my thing so fuck you mugs
Can’t dumb down when the gloves come off
I don’t care, either way, you’re getting punched up bruv
Emcees throw a dismal punch
Can’t spit/ no pistol when fists go up
So they talk slick/ tweet with their lips all shut
Hidden when the villains let their pitbulls run
Sniffing out their minimal ability
And kill ‘em within minutes of revealing where they stay
Finish them/ it’s vicious/ unh
Spit all I envision in my inner chamber
Door’s locked/ no entry
I enter only when I vent I know me
I need that fuel and I ignore the danger
I go to God when I feel deranged
And I feel that anger and I can’t contain it
I slowly feel I might go insane
‘Cause I’m running in circles inside my brain
It’s just madness/ climaxing
A hyperactive overload of life and passion so

Fuck up with me?
Then you must not have heard
Put me in dirt?
Then I’ll fuck up the Earth
Do what I do when I fuck up a verse
But I’ll do it you when I fuck up the world
That’s how I react
Hence why I feel like I need this track
Won’t even take too long
All you gotta do is do me wrong

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher

My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know

Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

Aunque nunca pude dejarla de amar
Poco a poco se convierte en mi enemigo el tiempo
Se la llevo sin vuelta atras

Ay yo le pido a mi pana que no se ponga terco
Por ella pongase a luchar
Mas vale amor seguro que cuatrocientas corriendo
(he dicho!) pongase a pensar

No se si mi condena será seguir solo
O sentenciarme a no volverla a ver
Yo solo estoy seguro
De que me arrepiento de su sufrimiento

Voy buscando su rastro detras de su aliento
Yo se que he fallado y aqui me arrepiento

Sin ella a mi la vida se me va perdiendo
Si no la tengo a mi lado sintiendo su cuerpo
Un corazon desolado que se esta muriendo
Y vuela y vuelve ma'
Que tu iluminas mi sendero
Y vuela y vuelve ma'
Que nada es igual sin ti

Entonces buscala buscala ya!

And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the colour of a constellation

Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he feel today

You feel like no one can relate

Never no pancakes in the kitchen

In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end

Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do

That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

Dope shit like that, Jerm
Oh, hi
Welcome back to K.I.D.S., um
Follow your dreams
Yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Wanna get a mansion, a jacuzzi
A theater to watch my movies
Couple whips and lots of fancy things
The kids they call the Goonies
I see the future, crystal ball
Mirror mirror hangin' on the wall
Who the flyest white boy of them all?
Got your girlfriend screenin' all the calls
She bubblin', we fuckin', then you cuddlin'
Like, baby, where the fuck you been?
Don't wanna tell you she in love with him
So, so we ain't sayin' nothin'
You could probably tell she bluffin'
'Cause she kiss you with the mouth
She gave me head with my concussion
Yeah, she blushin', all red
Wanna rush and go to bed
You interrogate that bitch like you the feds
So she says she in love with a rockstar, rockstar
Wanna smoke my weed, so she asks me where the tops are, tops are
[Chorus: Empire of the Sun & Mac Miller]
Oh (Top drawer, haha), oh, oh (Yeah)
Honey, I need you 'round (Haha)
I know, I know (Just some motherfuckin' kids)
Oh, oh, oh
Honey, I need you 'round (Make money, fuck bitches)
I know (Yeah), I know (Pittsburgh, hey, Jerm, hey)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
These hoes is drunk, wanna come and smoke this blunt
Then let me take 'em home and do anything I want
I said, baby, I can ride you, just let me get inside you
I can take you higher if you hit this vaporizer
I got that dope dick, I'll be your supplier
You grabbin' on my sheets and hittin' notes like you Mariah
Obsessed with me
Undress a freak on ecstasy
I'm out and then she textin' me
Like, ""What you doin' next week, next week?"" (Yeah)

[Bridge: Empire of the Sun & Mac Miller]
Hear me now
I'm down on knees and praying
Though my faith is weak
Without you so please, baby, please
Give us a chance
Make amends and I will stand up 'til the end
A million times, a trillion more (Hey)
[Chorus: Empire of the Sun & Mac Miller]
Oh, oh, oh (Hey, I just wanted to inform y'all)
Honey, I need you 'round (I'm drunk as fuck)
I know, I know (Most Dope, bitch, hey)
Oh, oh, oh (K.I.D.S., what's up?)
Honey, I need you 'round (I'm high as fuck, yeah, yes, sir)
I know, I know (Oh, I graduated, oh yeah, I just graduated high school, haha)

[Outro: Mac Miller & Empire of the Sun]
Hey, homie
Don't be mad that your girl loves me (Don't cut anything yet)
It's not my fault (Yeah)
I'm just doin' me (Haha)
If your girl love me, let her love me, you feel me?
So, baby
Smile (Uh-huh)
Baby, don't cry
I will only fly
With you by my side25Embed"

Somethin' wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive

She need her daddy, baby, please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

Just a moment
Right before all the song and dance
Wasn't brave enough to tell you
But there ain't gonna be another chance
It's not long until (All that I have)
And everything's still (One more hour)
Minutes are racing, whatever I've done
I did it for love (All that I have)
I did it for fun (One more hour)
Couldn't get enough (All that I have)
I did it for fame (One more hour)
But never for money
Not for houses, not for her
Not for my future children
Until now
[Verse 2]
How could I love again?
How could I ever ask for more?
And to the road ahead
Into a life I can't ignore
(Lose her) How could I love again?
(Move on) How can I walk this path for sure?
(Lose her) With no more time to spare
(Move on) I know the answer more and more

[Chorus]
As long as I can, long as I can
Spend some time alone
As long as I can, long as I can
Be the man I am

[Bridge]
Ooh, life is strange
For one more hour
I can rage
For one more hour

As long as I can (Lose her), as long as I can (Move on)
Spend some time alone
As long as I can (Lose her), as long as I can (Move on)
Remember who I am
As long as I can (Lose her), as long as I can (Move on)
Spend some time alone
As long as I can (How could I love again?), as long as I can
Be the man I am

Just a minute, fella, right before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute bare
One more hour and you'll know your life is one to share
Just a minute, baby, right before we go from here

I'm with you and I could roll into another year

Beastly
Peel the layers back, see me
Feel you right on track
Beastly
Peel the layers back, see me
Feel you right on track

Take it always slowly, piece by piece
You got this funny idea that you'll eventually release
Naming can be costly it'll never be discreet
You hold it in your dreams because it's easy to believe
Beastly
Peel the layers back, see me
Feel you right on track
Beastly
Peel the layers back, see me
Feel you right on track

Fancy enough feel, feel you caught around your sleeve
Feel you caught up in between
Feel she's too good to be seen
Chance it for a nice you feel it something let to please
Close your eyes towards the seas, while all unravelin' at the seams

Beastly
Peel the layers back, see me
Feel you right on track
Beastly
Peel the layers back, see me
Feel you right on track

And if the tricks don't fool enough
It's only us
It's only rough
We didn't sink enough
We didn't sing enough
And if the pools not smooth
It's strong
We'll float along
Never minding that both of the oars are gone
We didn't sink enough

Switch and row
Even with eight hands
I can't bear this pull alone
This sinking feeling inside is too heavy a load
Switch and row
It's too heavy to hide, it's too heavy a load
Switch and row
It',s too heavy to hide and too heavy a load

And if the tricks don't fool enough
It's only us
It's only rough
We didn't sink enough
We didn't sing enough

And if the pools not smooth
It's strong
We'll float along
Never minding that both of the oars are gone
Even with eight hands I can't bear this pull alone
This sinking feeling inside is too heavy a load

Red Line,chelechepe,['Geordie Kieffer'],6DaKU06d03UDpVjPZhF19X,databcn072022,"Red Line Lyrics[Verse 1]
I come from a long, long line of denim jean
Cut beside all types of fiends
I robbed the DEA and overdosed
Spend the cash on guns and coke
I am the warmonger, more crazy strong
Droppin' drones inside Iran
I’m the big, bad, super-charged sex machine
All-American, extra lean

[Chorus]
If you lose your cool
Baby, I'll lose mine
You draw the red line
I love crossing red lines
[Post-Chorus]
Lose your cool
Baby, I'll lose mine
You draw the red line
I'll see you on the other side

[Verse 2]
I'll take the M-1-5 and a pound of green
I'm the triple-round king of ketamine
I'm not fixin' me, I'm fixin' you
You can take these pills, red, white, and blue
They go down, down, down with a pack of beer
Then your eyes go dark and you cannot hear
I might tie you up, see what you got
I got a feelin' that you're gonna get hot

[Chorus]
If you lose your cool
Baby, I'll lose mine
You draw the red line
I love crossing red lines

[Bridge]
Full stop
You talk that talk
You walk that walk
Who wears the red line?
Maybe we can work it out
Maybe we can work it out
Oh, my friend
You seem upset
What's on your mind?
Woah, you got somethin' you want to say?
Well, look me in the eye
[Chorus]
Woah, if you lose your cool
Maybe I'll lose mine
You draw the red line
I love crossing red lines2Embed"
Crave You,chelechepe,"['Flight Facilities', 'Giselle']",6DaKU06d03UDpVjPZhF19X,databcn072022,"Crave You Lyrics[Chorus]
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
One moment I have you, the next, you are gone
Rehearsed steps on an empty stage
That boy's got my heart in a silver cage
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I crave you

[Verse 1]
I walked into the room dripping in gold
Yeah, dripping in gold
I walked into the room dripping in gold
Dripping in gold
A wave of heads did turn, or so I've been told
Or so I've been told
My heart broke when I saw you kept your gaze controlled
Oh, I cannot solve
[Chorus]
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
One moment I have you, the next, you are gone
Rehearsed steps on an empty stage
That boy's got my heart in a silver cage
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I crave you

[Post-Chorus]
It's true, I crave you
Crave you
It's true, I crave you
Crave you

[Bridge]
Let's just stop and think before I lose face
Surely I can't fall, into a game of chase
Around his little finger, that boy has got me curled
I try to reach out, but he's in his own world
This boy's got my head tied in knots with all his games
I simply want him more because he looks the other way

[Chorus]
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
One moment I have you, the next, you are gone
Rehearsed steps on an empty stage
That boy's got my heart in a silver cage
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I crave you
[Outro]
I am craving you
I am craving you44Embed"

If I Ever Feel Better,chelechepe,['Phoenix'],6DaKU06d03UDpVjPZhF19X,databcn072022,"If I Ever Feel Better Lyrics[Intro]
They say an end can be a start
Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
It's like a bad day that never ends
I feel the chaos around me
A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There are things in my life that I can't control

[Verse 1]
They say love ain't nothing but a sore
I don't even know what love is
Too many tears have had to fall
Don't you know I'm so tired of it all
I have known terror dizzy spells
Finding out the secrets words won't tell
Whatever it is it can't be named
There's a part of my world that's fading away
You know I don't want to be clever
To be brilliant or superior
True like ice, true like fire
Now I know that a breeze can blow me away
Now I know there's much more dignity
In defeat than in the brightest victory
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please, tell me please
[Chorus]
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know

[Verse 2]
Hang on to the good days
I can lean on my friends
They help me going through hard times
But I'm feeding the enemy
I'm in league with the foe
Blame me for what's happening
I can't try, I can't try, I can't try, I can't try
No one knows the hard times I went through
If happiness came I miss the call
The stormy days ain't over
I've tried and lost now I think that I pay the cost
Now I've watched all my castles fall
They were made of dust, after all
Someday all this mess will make me laugh
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait

[Chorus]
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know
[Bridge]
It's like somebody took my place
I ain't even playing my own game
The rules have changed well I didn't know
There are things in my life I can't control
I feel the chaos around me
A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There's a part of my life that will go away
Dark is the night, cold is the ground
In the circular solitude of my heart
As one who strives a hill to climb
I am sure I'll come through I don't know how
They say an end can be a start
Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please, tell me please

[Chorus]
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know28Embed"

Driftin'
Huh, huh, huh, Tokyo driftin'

[Verse 1: Dave Bayley]
Two things 'bout the gears, you better listen up
Chrome spokes with the spinners on his tire hubs
Suck smoke in his '40, windows up
He rolls, like he really doesn't give a-
Drug lust and two packets in your pocket
Disco dust hits your nose like a rocket

Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

Scoot-scoot, boy, race out to the super-club
Let it rip like you drank all of the tequila
Get loose, Street Fighter, tear it up
Fresh footwork drippin' out of you onto the rug

[Chorus: Dave Bayley & Denzel Curry]
Ooh, now you're lettin' go
Heart beatin' faster, feet pushin' on the floor
Ain't nothin' better
Ooh, now you're lettin' go

Ayy, what is everybody talkin' 'bout?
When they wanna live fast, but I'd rather walk it out
Niggas wanna talk about a G
But I spent a G on the twelve teeth in my mouth (Huh, huh, huh)
Diamonds aquatic, it feel like a trout on my wrist (Wrist)
Or a spout on my wrist with a spider up in it (In it)
Everything gotta be eighty and you keep the twenty percentage
You know that I get it, I'm on it, I'm in it
If you try to take it, the clip get extended
I'm back on my bullshit, like Jordan on Pippen
If this is my life then I'm Tokyo drifting (Uh)

Used to Be in Love,Hassan,['The Jungle Giants'],6DaKU06d03UDpVjPZhF19X,databcn072022,"Used To Be In Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
You could be my little dream
I'll read you like a magazine
While we're bored and while we're young
The viewing is easy
But I was at the first to come
To realise what I hadn't done
Something I caught in a gun
For something so easy

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my heart stitched love
[Chorus]
Used to be in love but you ran off
Used to get along but you ran away
Frozen to the feeling when you backed up
You took my heart when you ran away

[Verse 2]
Mirror this, I'll write your name
Leave a little message too
Eyes are shining diamond blue
Make heaven come closer to you
And when you finally come down
To realise what you hadn't found
If there's anything like solid ground
Don't let it go sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, my heart stitched love

[Chorus]
Used to be in love but you ran off
Used to get along but you ran away
Frozen to the feeling when you backed up
You took my heart when you ran away
Used to be in love but you ran off
Used to get along but you ran away
Frozen to the feeling when you backed up
You took my heart when you ran away

You took my heart when you ran away
