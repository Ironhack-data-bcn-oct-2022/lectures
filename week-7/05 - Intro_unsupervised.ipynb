    "## PCA\n",
    "**Main Component Analysis**\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method that allows simplifying the complexity of sample spaces with many dimensions while preserving their information. Suppose there is a sample with n individuals each with p variables (X1, X2, …, Xp), that is, the sample space has p dimensions. PCA allows to find a number of underlying factors (z<p) that explain approximately the same as the original p variables. Where before p values ​​were needed to characterize each individual, now z values ​​suffice. Each of these z new variables is called the principal component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis belongs to the family of techniques known as unsupervised learning. The supervised learning methods described in previous chapters have the objective of predicting a response variable Y from a series of predictors. To do this, we have p characteristics (X1, X2 … Xp) and the response variable Y measured in n observations. In the case of unsupervised learning, the response variable Y is not taken into account since the objective is not to predict Y but to extract information using the predictors, for example, to identify subgroups. The main problem faced by unsupervised learning methods is the difficulty in validating the results given that there is no response variable available that allows them to be contrasted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PCA method therefore allows \"condensing\" the information provided by multiple variables into just a few components. This makes it a very useful method to apply after using other statistical techniques such as regression, clustering... Even so, we must not forget that it is still necessary to have the value of the original variables to calculate the components."

    "The elbow curve method is useful because it shows how increasing the number of clusters contributes to separating the clusters in a significant, not marginal, way. The curve indicates that additional groups beyond the third have little value. The elbow method is pretty neat, but a naive solution based on intracluster variance. The gap statistic is a more sophisticated method of dealing with data that has a distribution with no obvious clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method works as follows: the sum of squared errors within the cluster is calculated for different values ​​of K and the K is chosen for which the sum of squared errors begins to decrease. This is visible as an elbow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sum within a group of squared errors sounds a bit complex. Let's break it down:\n",

    "The squared error for each point is the square of the point's distance from its plot, that is, its predicted cluster center.\n",
    "The sum of squared errors score is the sum of these squared errors for all points.\n",
